            <p className='Text'>DANRED aka Angelou Sereño is an independent artist currently staying in Cebu City, Philippines. He is a self-taught producer and started to produce songs at the age 
            of 15-years old but never released a song until it was August of 2022. With a debut single "That's Why I Wrote This Song" which gathered 1k streams on
            Spotify alone in a few months. He also released a single on September 2022 which was his in the language of, "Bisaya" (his first dialect) which was titled, "Ania Rako" a heartbreak
            song that stemmed from unrequited love. DANRED has his influences traced back from his choir roots and some various Pop artists, to name a few: Jeremy Zucker, 
            Demi Lovato, Taylor Swift, NIKI, etc. Now with his new EP "Sincerely Yours" he is there to give us an open letter of love and adventure with his songs, "Sincerely yours, 
            Truly Yours, I'll Go" and "Your Direction." Now, we wonder where is DANRED gonna head next? An album perhaps?</p>
